                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Macintosh was intended to be an ambitious, brand-new computer, separate from the Apple II that came years before. Built in around 1984, this model is an evolution of the Jef Raskin prototype from 1981. Unlike the earlier model, it is encased in a faded white plastic shell, positioned side-to-side with a unique prototype single-button mouse and floppies containing never-seen-before Apple-developed software. Instead of a basic terminal of earlier Apple computers, the operating system was a full-fledged greyscale graphical interface. Coveted as the holy grail of yesteryear's lost consumer technology, many have speculated as to what impact the device would have had on the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Indeed, the infamous "1984" commercial -- shown at the 1984 Super Bowl -- and the 18-page brochure printed in magazines were a glimpse into a time when its release appeared certain. But 21 years later, the buyer will be bringing the device home where they can use it, exactly as the minds at Apple Computer, Inc. intended all that time ago.

Much speculation was made about his absence, with some citing family and others citing his satisfaction with the state of Apple at the time, drawing from <span style="text-decoration:underline;">his 2012 interview</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Multiple Apple alumni, including present CEO Tim Cook, have commented on his absence. "I always thought there was more to Steve than just Apple," commented Cook in 2011. "Perhaps that was why. And I wouldn't blame him in that case."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Since then, he has mostly faded into the background—at least, in the public eye. A string of tech startups pointing to him as a reason for their success tells a different story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Among the beneficiaries are OnePlus co-founders Peter Lau and Carl Pei. OnePlus is a relative newcomer to the smartphone market that entered in 2014 with the OnePlus One, which ArsTechnica had reviewed that year. It has recently introduced a pair of wireless earbuds named the OnePlus Buds to go with the OnePlus 6, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">released earlier this year</span>. Since its founding, the company has grown to an estimated annual revenue of $2.4 billion, with its latest model alone selling 1.7 million units.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Pei owes part of his success to Steve Jobs. "Just like that, I had the most valuable 35 years of experience," he said. In particular, he said that the former Apple CEO had <span style="text-decoration:underline;">actively coached him</span> and Lau on operations, management and vision in addition to providing funding. He even shared a self-depreceating joke told by Steve Jobs that in order to be like him, he would have to first "fail, get kicked out, fail elsewhere, and then get brought back in by the same company that kicked [him] out."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Moderna, a medtech company known for its novel mRNA-based vaccines, is speculated to have also received Steve Jobs' blessing. Keen eyes would note that he had been diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer that he'd announced was "100% eliminated from [his] system" as of 2007. Unlike OnePlus, Moderna has yet to comment on his role, although Steve Jobs himself has <span style="text-decoration:underline;">alluded to his connection</span> to the company, saying he was "very interested in Moderna and their potential to ensure a much easier time with pancreatic cancer for everyone than [he] had."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The list can go on between Instacart, Chili Piper, and other companies. But one notable exception is the now-defunct Theranos, infamously known for its founder's highly-publicized feud with Steve Jobs and its subsequent <span style="text-decoration:underline;">2013 scandal</span> regarding exaggerated claims on their technology. I had previously written about <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Steve Jobs throwing an egg at its front doors</span>, but the most important bit is that it happened after he was reportedly shown around a fake lab in an effort to woo him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    "They should've known better than to try to fool a man who knows what development looks like," he said in a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">2014 interview with WIRED</span>. "Now, the egg was in the heat of the moment. But when you're being pressured into giving up some of your hard-earned money especially after the smoke and mirrors? It's no wonder."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Indeed, helping startups isn't all he's been up to. More recently, Steve Jobs mentioned that his collection of Kawase Hasui's ukiyo-e was "almost complete" during an interview when asked about his admiration of Hasui among other artists. He has also delivered seminars centering around the future of green technology, most notably at the 2015 World Economic Forum.

                    And <span style="text-decoration:underline;">just yesterday</span>, he had visited Apple Park for the first time earlier this year, as one tweet from Apple SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi would have it. Maybe that was his \"one last thing\" for the year.

                <p>
                Steve used to say to me -- and he used to say this a lot -- “Hey Jony, here’s a dopey idea.” And sometimes they were really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room, and they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones which, in their subtlety, their detail, were utterly profound.
                </p>
                <p>
                And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. I think he -- better than anyone -- understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.
                </p>
                <p>
                I loved the way that he listened so intently. I loved his perception, his remarkable sensitivity, and his surgically precise opinion. I really believe there was a beauty in how singular, how keen his insight was, even though sometimes it could sting.
                </p>
                <p>
                As I’m sure many of you know, Steve didn’t confine his sense of excellence to making products. When we travelled together, we would check in and I’d go up to my room. And I’d leave my bags very neatly by the door. And I wouldn’t unpack. And I would go and sit on the bed. I would go and sit on the bed next to the phone. And I would wait for the inevitable phone call: “Hey Jony, this hotel sucks. Let’s go.”
                </p>
                <p>
                He used to joke that the lunatics had taken over the asylum, as we shared a giddy excitement spending months and months working on a part of a product that nobody would ever see. Not with their eyes. We did it because we really believed it was right because we cared. He believed that there was a gravity, almost a sense of civic responsibility, to care way beyond any sort of functional imperative.
                </p>
                <p>
                While the work hopefully appeared inevitable, appeared simple and easy, it really cost. It cost us all, didn’t it? But you know what? It cost him most. He cared the most. He worried the most deeply. He constantly questioned, “Is this good enough? Is this right?” And despite all his successes, all his achievements, he never assumed that we would get there in the end. When the ideas didn’t come, and when the prototypes failed, it was with great intent, with faith, that he decided to believe we would eventually make something great.
                </p>
                <p>
                But the joy of getting there! I loved his enthusiasm, his simple delight (often, I think, mixed with some relief) that, yeah, we got there. We got there in the end and it was good. You can see his smile, can’t you? The celebration of making something great for everybody, enjoying the defeat of cynicism, the rejection of reason, the rejection of being told a hundred times, “You can’t do that.” So his, I think, was a victory for beauty, for purity, and, as he would say, for giving a damn.
                </p>
                <p>
                He was my closest and my most loyal friend. We worked together for nearly fifteen years.
                </p>
                <p>
                And he still laughed at the way I say “aluminium.”
                </p>
                <p>
                For the past two weeks, we’ve all been struggling to find ways to say goodbye. This morning I simply want to end by saying, “Thank you, Steve.” Thank you for your remarkable vision, which has united and inspired this extraordinary group of people. For all that we have learned from you, and for all that we will continue to learn from each other:
                </p>

                Thank you, Steve.

            (08/02/01)

            Microsoft has lost its appeal case, which sought to reverse the decision made in United States v. Microsoft Corp.
            </p>
            <p>
            Following escalation to the Supreme Court, associate justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion citing that Microsoft "had engaged in activities counter to the Sherman Antitrust Law" and that "its remaining competition proved, and continues to prove insufficient in ensuring a healthy market balance." The Redmond tech company is set to split into four entities, each handling different segments of its former business.
            </p>
            <p>
            Millennium Technologies will take on development of the dominant Windows operating system.
            </p>
            <p>
            Tantra will assume Internet Explorer's development.
            </p>
            <p>
            Hardware Abstractions will oversee the Xbox platform and APIs related to it and Windows.
            </p>
            <p>
            Microsoft will continue its programming language and development tool business, exactly how it had started off back in 1975.
            </p>
            <p>
            The US government has also launched an incubator program to fast-track development of alternative operating systems to Windows, which enjoys a near-total monopoly following the liquidation of Apple Computer, Inc's assets. Details are sparse, but Linux, an open-source operating system started by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds, is speculated to be a candidate. Other rumored candidates include Inferno, FreeBSD, BeOS, Solaris, eComStation, and RISC OS.
            </p>
            <p>
            The last time a large company had been broken up by the courts was back in 1982 when AT&T had settled, allowing its continued business in long-distance phone services and computer technology research while the colloquially-termed Baby Bells assumed the rest of its business. Since then, the Bell companies have been recombining thanks in part to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed them to enter the long-distance service market.
            </p>
            <p>
            Time will tell how the spinoff companies will perform. For now, users of the aforementioned products will not see a significant impact.

            Windows Phone started off life as a promising alternative to Android and iOS five years ago. Microsoft positioned its range of Windows Phone 7 handsets as the true third mobile ecosystem, but it's time to admit it has failed. If a lack of devices from phone makers and even Microsoft itself wasn't enough evidence, the final nail in the coffin hit today. Microsoft only sold 4.5 million Lumia devices in the recent quarter, compared to 10.5 million at the same time last year. That's a massive 57 percent drop. Even a 57 percent increase wouldn't be enough to save Windows Phone right now.
            </p>
            <p>
            Microsoft and Nokia have sold a total of 110 million Windows Phones compared to 4.5 billion iOS and Android phones in the same period. IDC recently reported that 400 million phones were sold in the recent quarter, meaning just 1.1 percent of them were Lumia Windows Phones. Microsoft does not have any compelling Lumia handsets, and the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL were both disappointing flagship devices with unfinished Windows 10 Mobile software.

            With Lumia sales on the decline and Microsoft's plan to not produce a large amount of handsets, it's clear we're witnessing the end of Windows Phone. Rumors suggest Microsoft is developing a Surface Phone, but it has to make it to the market first. Windows Phone has long been in decline and its app situation is only getting worse. With a lack of hardware, lack of sales, and less than 2 percent market share, it's time to call it: Windows Phone is dead. Real Windows on phones might become a thing with Continuum eventually, but Windows Phone as we know it is done. It won't stop Microsoft producing a few handsets every year as a vanity project, but for everyone else it's the end of the line. Farewell, Windows Phone.

            <p>
            NBC has all but confirmed that the US remake of popular British sitcom "The Office" will not be receiving a second season.
            </p>
            <p>
            Developed by Greg Daniels, "The Office", like its English original, presented a mock documentary of a troubled corporation. Instead of the likes of Ricky Gervais, Martin Freeman, Mackenzie Crook, and Lucy Davis, the show starred an ensemble of Steve Carell, John Krasinski, Rainn Wilson, Jenna Fischer, and B. J. Novak as Michael Scott, Jim Halpert, Dwight Schrute, Pam Beesly, and Ryan Howard respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
            "For a moment, it looked like we'd have a breakthrough," laments Daniels.
            </p>
            <p>
            An NBC spokesman pointed to low ratings as the prime reason for its cancellation. When we asked about any potential revival plans, he responded that "there are no plans to bring the show back at this moment."
            </p>
            <p>
            Despite hopes that Judd Apatow's "The 40 Year-Old Virgin", also starring Carell, would bring attention to the show, it now serves as a bellwether for the actor's future career in film. Krasinski, meanwhile, has guest starred in shows like police drama "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and is set to appear in a future episode of "Without a Trace." It is unknown as to what Wilson and Fischer will star in, although Novak has expressed interest in filmmaking in light of "The Office"'s cancellation.
            </p>
            <p>
            But Daniels is not giving up on the show. In the same interview, he has mentioned shopping the show around various networks for a revival. "I haven't had much luck so far," says the former showrunner, "but I'm not giving up that easily, am I now?"
            </p>
            <p>
            Time will tell whether "The Office" will get a reappraisal from networks or remain a "Freaks and Geeks"-esque cult classic. For now, fans can expect a release of the show as it exists now on DVD.

            ★★★☆ <button><b>FAMILY</b></button> 103 minutes ‧ G ‧ 2010
            </h4>
            <p>
            Roger Ebert | June 16, 2010 | 3 min read
            </p>
            <p>
            The first two "Toy Story" movies centered on the relationship between a boy and his toys. In Disney/Pixar's "Toy Story 3," Andy has grown to college age and the story leaves the toys pretty much on their own. In a third act where they find themselves fighting for life on a conveyor belt to a garbage incinerator, we fear it could be renamed "Toy Story Triage."
            </p>
            <p>
            The problems all begin with that most dreaded of commands, "Clean out your room!" No mother in history understands that a boy's room has all of his stuff exactly where he needs it, even if he dumped it there 10 years earlier. Andy's mom gives him three choices: (1) attic; (2) donation to a day-care center; (3) trash. As Andy examines his old toys, his gaze lingers fondly on Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), and he decides to take him along to college.
            </p>
            <p>
            What with one thing and another, the other toys find themselves at the day-care center, which they think they'll like, because there will be plenty of kids to play with them all day long. There seems to be relatively little grieving about the loss of Andy's affections; he did, after all, sentence them to a toy box for years, and toys by nature are self-centered and want to be played with.
            </p>
            <p>
            Day care seems like a happy choice, until a dark underside of its toy society emerges in the person of an ominously hug-prone bear named Lotso (Ned Beatty). They pick up, however, some additions to their little band, including a Ken doll with an extensive wardrobe. If you ask me, Barbie (Jodi Benson) is anorexic, and Ken (Michael Keaton) is gay, but nobody in the movie knows this, so I'm just sayin'.

            Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is back, still in hapless hero mode, but after a reboot, he starts speaking Spanish and that leads to some funny stuff. I also enjoyed the plight of Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris), whose missing eye continues to see independently of her head. This raises intriguing physiological questions, such as, if Mr. Potato Head lost an ear, would it continue to hear, or if he lost a mouth, would it continue to eat without a body? These are not academic questions; at one point, Mister becomes an uncooked taco shell. Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head must be old hands at such situations, because children spend most of their time attaching his body parts in the wrong way, like malpracticing little Dr. Frankensteins.

            Man, the toys have a dangerous time of it after they eventually find themselves at a garbage collection center. You have no idea what garbage has to go through before becoming landfill, and even an Indiana Jones toy would have trouble surviving the rotating blades. There is a happy ending, of course, but I suspect these toys may be traumatized for eternity.

            This is a jolly, slapstick comedy, lacking the almost eerie humanity that infused the earlier "Toy Story" sagas, and happier with action and jokes than with characters and emotions. But hey, what can you expect from a movie named "Toy Story 3," especially with the humans mostly offstage? I expect its target audience will love it, and at the box office, it may take right up where "How to Train Your Dragon" left off. Just don't get me started about the 3-D.
